# meleeWHR

This was my final project for CS 555 (Data Science) at WKU.

## Executive summary
I used Python, specifically BeautifulSoup/Requests, to scrape bracket data for Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments, which was then cleaned/transformed using Ruby fed match by match into the Whole-History Ranking algorithm. This produced a ranking of the game's top players over time, which can be seen below:
