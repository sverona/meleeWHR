The '''Smash Summit Donation Shop''' is a donation drive hosted on [[smash.gg]] to help raise the event's prizepool as well as add various side events or perks to the tournament such as an Ironman Bracket, a Double Draft Team Battle, or a special episode of the Toph & Scar Show @ Summit.

For every $5 donated, 1 vote for the Donation Drive Round is given, as well as 5 votes for one's initial donation.
